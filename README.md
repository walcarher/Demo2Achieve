# Demo2Achieve

Demo X-MERA (CHIMERA: Co-processor's Heterogeneity Integreation for smart caMERAs) 

Embedded Heterogeneous Partitioning CPU-GPU-FPGA for:

	-  Quantized Tensor Transfers with Pytorch.
	-  CNN model deployment on the edge for heterogeneous platforms.
	-  YOLOv2 COCO DataSet and VHDL Generated Code. 
	-  Computer Vision applications with OpenCV.

Original code by @marvis https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2 for YOLOv2
Conversion of https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ into pytorch.

Added:

	- Nvidia Jetson TX2 Compatibility with Pytorch 
	- Intel Cyclone 10 GX support with Pytorch (tensor transfer with chimera_lib)
	- Support with imx219 sensor
	- Compatibility with generated VHDL code with Delirium in collaboration with Sma-RTy
